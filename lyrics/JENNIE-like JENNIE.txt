Ha, c'mon, it's gon' be fucking hard

Special edition and your AI couldn't copy
I'm leaving clues in the fittin' room and it's hot tea
No, I'm not thinking about no exes, know they miss me
I got the whole room spinning like it's tipsy
Don't bore us, take you to the chorus

Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?
Like, like, like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
I think I really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
Haters, they don't really like (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
'Cause they could never ever be (JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE)
But have you ever met 
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE

But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?
But have you ever met?


얼말 줘도 못해 서커스짓
포징한번에 만들어 mosh pit
They can't deal with me 'cause I'm priceless
여러 셀럽들 속에 내 DNA
Get, get outta my way
바비가 처키가 되기 전에
Name, shame, blame tryna burst my bubble
터트려봐 그럼 더 큰 홀에서
만나는 거야 제니를 keep shading
예술작품엔 필요해 frame이
I've slayed it, and I graved it
Yes, I'm guilty 잘난 게 죄니 (Mmh)

Who wanna rock with JENNIE?
Keep your hair done, nails done like JENNIE
Who else got 'em obsessed like JENNIE?
Like, like, like

Haters, they don't really like JENNIE
'Cause they could never ever be JENNIE
But have you ever met 
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE?
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
It's JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
Like JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE, JENNIE
Rock with JENNIE
