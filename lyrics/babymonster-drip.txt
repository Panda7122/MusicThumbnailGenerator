When I dress, I don't think so much
I could be the GOAT, I don't need too much

Hittin' me up 'cause I got what they like
Baby, got no chance, better hit that dance

Mm, na-na-na, I'll be there, 고민하지 마
Uh, na-na-na, I'll be there, 망설이지 마
But you don't know 'bout me
Yeah, yeah, you gon' know 'bout me, boy
아름다운 별들이 빛나는 밤이야

Mm, what you say? (What you say?)
끝없는 가치, you know it's all me
Got that, ooh, what you say?
 ( What you say? )
Are you ready? Set, turn on the lights

Baby, holla, what's up? (What's up?)

Y to the G, no copy, no knock off
Bet on my life, this pitch I'm gon' walk-off
MONSTIEZ

끝까지 밟아, you know we gon' ride

Mmm, na-na-na, I'll be there, 고민하지 마
