CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 136.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.54 GiB of which 190.12 MiB is free. Process 297654 has 9.60 MiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 21.82 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 20.85 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 679.21 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
